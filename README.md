# Pitlake-Inventory-Project-India-
The Pitlake Inventory Project aims to cover each and every Indian pit lake under one hood. This would facilitate a better flow of information to the stakeholders and also would be beneficial to the pit lake researchers. In this repository, anyone can submit an excel sheet with general information regarding pitlakes from their respective regions. The general information should include Latitude, Longitude, Area, Elevation, Location Name, State and Owner's Name. Optional information may be provided which can include WTCL, water quality, no. of floral species, no. of faunal species, pH etc.
